# YelpCamp webapp

## Based on the YelpCamp project from Colt Steele's [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).

## About branches

###v<x> Branches
Version branches (e.g., v1) correspond to Colt's version files. Whenever he moves to a new version of the project in the course, I created a new branch to better keep track of discrete changes in the app that form a block of learning.

###Master Branch
The master branch contains the composite of the entire web application. After each version branch is complete, I've merged the branch back into master, while preserving the version branches for reference.
